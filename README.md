What started out as a wrapper for the Erlang [erlguten](https://github.com/ztmr/erlguten) library has turned into a full rewrite in Elixir.

This is a branch specifially focused on incrementally staging the features needed for correct OpenType embedding and rendering. See upstream for a stable build and the arabic branch for more complete (but very hacky) implementation.
